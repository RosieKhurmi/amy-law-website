            <p>This section is a message from the developer that made this website. I am so lucky to finally have a loving older sister. You have already taught me so much and I cannot wait to continue this amazing bond we have with each other and be powerhouses of women together. This website serves as a placeholder for the one I will make you when you start your own law firm.</p>
