<h1>Congratulations</h1>
<h2>To our new lawyer</h2>
<p>Always remember that you are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, smarter than you think, and loved and will be loved more than you know!</p>

<p>Congratulations to our dearest Amy, we are so proud of your dedication, hard work and intellect. The Canadian Justice System should be honored to have an amazing person like you. Our son got so fascinated by your law degree that he proposed to you in Osgoode Law School.</p>

<h3>Love from your Khurmi Family</h3>
